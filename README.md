This project is meant to compare two differential evolution methods: classic version (DE) and improved one (BBDE). There are several testing functions considered for different parameters, specific for algorithm used. For methodology and comparison result, see project documentation.
To setup project:
```
# download project
git clone https://github.com/TrywialnyOrzech/DifferentialEvolutionComparison
cd DifferentialEvolutionComparison

# create Python virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run prepared comparison:
```
python main.py
```
